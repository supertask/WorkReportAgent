# Video conversion settings
compression:
  # Constant Rate Factor (0-51). Lower is better quality, higher is smaller size.
  # 20: High quality (larger size)
  # 28: Balanced (Current optimized setting, ~15MB)
  # 32: Small size (~8.5MB, lower quality)
  crf: 32
  
  # Encoding speed/compression ratio.
  # Options: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow.
  # veryslow provides best compression (smallest file size) but takes longer to encode.
  preset: "veryslow"
  
  # Video codec. 
  # libx264: Widely supported, good balance.
  # libx265: Better compression for static scenes, but slower encoding and compatibility vary.
  codec: "libx264"

timelapse:
  # Factor to calculate speedup. Speed factor = Input FPS / speed_divisor.
  # Example: 24fps / 2.0 = 12x speedup.
  speed_divisor: 2.0
  
  # Output FPS control.
  # "auto": Keeps input video's FPS (Recommended to avoid dropped frames/jitter).
  # Number (e.g., 30): Forces output to specific FPS.
  output_fps: "auto"
